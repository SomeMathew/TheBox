# The Box
## Lockbox with facial recognition using openCV.


`The Box` is a prototype of an intelligent safe controlled by image recognition. 
It makes use of a BeagleBoneBlack (BBB) and an ATmega328P AVR microcontroller 
to provide computational power.  This project highlights how these devices 
can be used to implement several communication protocols, and how they 
can be used to interact with various external peripherals 
such as servo motors, accelerometers, reed switches, and cameras.

## Components
### BeagleBone Black
The scripts for the BeagleBone Black can be found in the `bbb/` directory.

### ATmega328P
#### Firmware
The firmware code for the AVR 328P can be found in the `avr/` directory.

#### Test
A test firmware for the SPI communication can be found in the `test/` directory.
